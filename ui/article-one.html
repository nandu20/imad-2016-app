          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 to a Hindu Modh Baniya family[14] in Porbandar (also known as
          Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the 
          Kathiawar Agency of the Indian Empire. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the diwan
          (chief minister) of Porbandar state

          The Gandhi family originated from the village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State. In the late 17th or
          early 18th century, one Lalji Gandhi moved to Porbandar and entered the service of its ruler, the Rana. Successive
          generations of the family served as civil servants in the state administration before Uttamchand, Mohandas's 
          grandfather, became diwan in the early 19th century under the then Rana of Porbandar, Khimojiraji. In 1831, Rana
          Khimojiraji died suddenly and was succeeded by his 12-year-old only son, Vikmatji. As a result, Rana Khimojirajji's
          widow, Rani Rupaliba, became regent for her son. She soon fell out with Uttamchand and forced him to return to his 
          ancestral village in Junagadh. While in Junagadh, Uttamchand appeared before its Nawab and saluted him with his left 
          hand instead of his right, replying that his right hand was pledged to Porbandar's service.In 1841, Vikmatji assumed
          the throne and reinstated Uttamchand as his diwan.

          In 1847, Rana Vikmatji appointed Uttamchand's son, Karamchand, as diwan after disagreeing with Uttamchand over the 
          state's maintenance of a British garrison. Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a
          clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister. During his tenure, Karamchand married
          four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless.
          In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also 
          came from Junagadh and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family.[18][19][20][21] Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over 
          the ensuing decade, a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860 – March 1914), a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960) and another son, Karsandas 
          (c. 1866–1913)
