          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 to a Hindu Modh Baniya family[14] in Porbandar (also known as
          Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the 
          Kathiawar Agency of the Indian Empire. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822â€“1885), served as the diwan
          (chief minister) of Porbandar state

          The Gandhi family originated from the village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State. In the late 17th or early 18th century, one Lalji Gandhi moved to Porbandar and entered the service of its ruler, the Rana. Successive generations of the family served as civil servants in the state administration before Uttamchand, Mohandas's grandfather, became diwan in the early 19th century under the then Rana of Porbandar, Khimojiraji. In 1831, Rana Khimojiraji died suddenly and was succeeded by his 12-year-old only son, Vikmatji. As a result, Rana Khimojirajji's widow, Rani Rupaliba, became regent for her son. She soon fell out with Uttamchand and forced him to return to his ancestral village in Junagadh. While in Junagadh, Uttamchand appeared before its Nawab and saluted him with his left hand instead of his right, replying that his right hand was pledged to Porbandar's service. In 1841, Vikmatji assumed the throne and reinstated Uttamchand as his diwan
